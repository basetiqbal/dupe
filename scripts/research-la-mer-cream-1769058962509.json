      "text": "I'm thinking of trying this, just to get an idea of what makes La Mer so \"amazing\". At the top of the ingredient list for Crème de la Mer is algae extract, and petrolatum and mineral oil make up the base for the cream. People say how plump La Mer makes their skin look and how their skin just *looks* better in general when they use the cream, and that's likely due to the algae extract which forms a film over the face, giving you a nice glow. It's also very soothing and full of minerals!\n\nSea Kelp",
